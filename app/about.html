                        help
                        is one
                        of the most powerful things a leader can do. As executive coaches, it’s a thrill to help

                        best and brightest leaders in the world.”</em></p>

                  <p><em>“Most CEOs have never truly learned how to assess talent, ask the most powerful leadership
                      questions
                      and proactively shape their own identity. In fact, they often don’t realize that asking for
                      help
                      is one
                      of the most powerful things a leader can do. As executive coaches, it’s a thrill to help
                      supercharge the
                      best and brightest leaders in the world.”</em></p>
